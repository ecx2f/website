# Welcome to ecx2f.dev

This is your first post. You can edit this file or create new posts by adding folders in the `/posts` directory.

## How it works

Each post lives in its own folder under `/posts`. The markdown file should be named `index.md` and can include frontmatter for metadata like title and date.

## Adding images

You can add images to your post by placing them in the same folder as your `index.md` file, then referencing them in markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](./cover.png)
```

## Next steps

1. Edit this post or create a new one
2. Customize the styles in `/styles`
3. Deploy to Netlify

Happy writing!
